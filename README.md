# Machine_Learning_Alg
[Datacamp](www.datacamp.com) is a very good learnign website with much real stuff for data analysis and viz, machine learning algorithm, R, Python and  so on. I have attended a bunch of the useful course on it.   
Based on these courses, I summarize all the useful code during the studying in this repository. There is also much more useful information and code from my opinions and other online resources.

The courses below are the ones I finished and highly recommend for learning machine learning with python:
